## We will study different kinds of Generative models

### Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a type of generative model that learn to encode data into a lower-dimensional latent space and reconstruct it back to the original space. They are trained to maximize the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO).

## ELBO (Evidence Lower Bound)

The ELBO is the objective function for VAEs and is composed of two terms:

1. The reconstruction loss, which encourages the decoder to accurately reconstruct the input data.
2. The KL divergence between the approximate posterior and the prior over latent variables, which acts as a regularizer.

## Issues with Standard VAEs

Standard VAEs can sometimes produce blurry images and have a poor latent space representation due to the powerful decoder networks ignoring the latent codes.

## InfoVAE

InfoVAE introduces a mutual information term into the VAE objective to preserve information between the latent variables and the observations, aiming to improve the learned latent representation.

## MMD VAE

MMD VAE replaces the KL divergence with Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), a tractable alternative that measures the distance between the aggregated posterior and the prior.

## Mutual Information Loss

The mutual information loss aims to maximize the information between latent variables and observations, which can be approximated using variational bounds.

## Pseudo Code for Mutual Information Loss

```python
def mutual_information_loss(q_z_given_x, q_z, z_samples):
    # Compute log probabilities
    log_q_z_given_x = q_z_given_x.log_prob(z_samples)
    log_q_z = q_z.log_prob(z_samples)
    
    # Mutual information is the expectation of the difference
    mi_loss = (log_q_z_given_x - log_q_z).mean()
    return mi_loss
```

Beta VAEs:

Î²-VAEs: Introduce a trade-off parameter to balance the latent space capacity and reconstruction quality.
Adversarial Autoencoders: Use a discriminator to enforce a prior on the latent space, leading to an adversarial training scheme.
