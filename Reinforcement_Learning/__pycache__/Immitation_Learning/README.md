## Immitation Learning

Two types of Immitation Learning

1. Behavioural cloning
2. Inverse Reinforcement learning

## Some issues to be considered for immitation learning

1. Distribution mismatch: The training dataset is generated by the expert driver, and the model's performance is highly dependent on the quality and diversity of this dataset. If the dataset does not cover certain situations or edge cases, the model may perform poorly in those scenarios. This is especially problematic if the model encounters a situation that it hasn't seen before, leading to potential safety issues.

2. Compounding errors: Since the model learns to mimic the expert's actions, any small errors in the model's predictions can accumulate over time, leading to significantly larger errors in the future. This is particularly troublesome in continuous control tasks, where small deviations can quickly result in the agent going off course or making other dangerous maneuvers.

3. Lack of interpretability: Behavioral cloning using continuous control often relies on complex neural network models, which are difficult to interpret and understand. This can make it challenging to diagnose issues or understand the model's decision-making process, potentially leading to trust and safety concerns.

4. Overfitting: Since behavioral cloning relies on supervised learning, it is prone to overfitting, especially when the training dataset is limited. Overfitting can lead to a model that performs well on the training data but generalizes poorly to new, unseen situations.

5. Suboptimal policies: Behavioral cloning learns to imitate the expert's behavior, which may not necessarily be the optimal way to perform the task. If the expert driver has any biases or suboptimal driving habits, the model will learn those too, potentially limiting its overall performance.

6. Data inefficiency: Collecting a large and diverse dataset of expert demonstrations can be time-consuming and expensive. Furthermore, supervised learning techniques generally require a significant amount of data to train a high-performing model. This can make behavioral cloning a data-inefficient approach to learning continuous control tasks.
