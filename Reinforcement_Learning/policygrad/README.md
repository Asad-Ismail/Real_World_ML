In the REINFORCE algorithm, we roll out the complete episodes because it is a Monte Carlo-based method, and the return (G_t) for each time step is required to compute the policy gradient. The return at time step t is calculated as the cumulative discounted reward from that time step until the end of the episode. Therefore, we need to wait until the episode ends to compute the returns and use them to update the policy.

In contrast, Q-learning is a temporal-difference (TD) learning method that bootstraps the value estimates using the current Q-values. It doesn't require waiting until the end of the episode to update the estimates. Instead, it uses the immediate reward and the estimated value of the next state to make the updates.

Although REINFORCE and Q-learning both aim to solve reinforcement learning problems, their methods for learning are fundamentally different. REINFORCE is a policy-based method that directly optimizes the policy using the gradient of the expected return. In contrast, Q-learning is a value-based method that learns the action-value function Q(s, a) and indirectly derives the policy from the learned Q-values.

It is possible to use other algorithms like Actor-Critic, which combine elements of policy-based and value-based methods, to perform updates as actions are taken, similar to Q-learning. Actor-Critic methods use a critic to estimate the value function (e.g., Q(s, a) or V(s)), which allows them to perform updates at each time step, reducing the variance of the policy gradient estimates and enabling faster learning.

Reinforce:
    The gradient of the log probability of the policy with respect to θ is:

    ∇_θ log π(a | s, θ)

    Now, let's calculate the gradient for each element θ_ij in the θ matrix:

    ∂(log π(a | s, θ)) / ∂θ_ij = ( ∂π(a | s, θ) / ∂θ_ij ) / π(a | s, θ)

    Using the softmax derivative property, we have:

    ∂π(a | s, θ) / ∂θ_ij = π(a | s, θ) * (s_j * (δ_ai - π(i | s, θ)))

    where δ_ai is the Kronecker delta, which equals 1 when a = i and 0 otherwise.

    Putting it all together, we get the gradient expression:

    ∇_θ log π(a | s, θ) = (s * (δ_a - π(a | s, θ)))^T

    where s is the state, π(a | s, θ) is the policy probability vector, and δ_a is a one-hot vector with a 1 at the position corresponding to the action a and 0 elsewhere.
