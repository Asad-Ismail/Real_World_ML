In simple linear regression, we can derive a closed-form solution for the coefficients (slope and intercept) using ordinary least squares (OLS) method. However, logistic regression uses a non-linear sigmoid function to model the probability of the outcome variable. The maximum likelihood estimation method is commonly used to estimate the coefficients in logistic regression. This method does not have a closed-form solution, and instead, numerical optimization techniques like gradient descent are used to find the optimal coefficients.
