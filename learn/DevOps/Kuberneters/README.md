## Test Driven Development

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the code that needs to be implemented. The process follows a simple cycle called "Red-Green-Refactor":

1. **Red**: Write a test for a new feature or improvement. Run the test, and it should fail since the feature isn't implemented yet. This failure is expected and confirms that the test is correctly detecting the absence of the feature.

2. **Green**: Write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the test pass. This phase focuses on functionality rather than perfect code structure or efficiency.

3. **Refactor**: With the test now passing, refactor the code to improve its structure, readability, or efficiency while keeping the test green. This step ensures that the codebase remains clean and maintainable.

The cycle repeats for each new feature or improvement, gradually building up the software with a suite of tests that verify its functionality. This approach has several benefits:

- **Early bug detection**: Bugs are identified and fixed sooner, which is typically more cost-effective.
- **Improved design**: Writing tests first helps developers focus on the interface and design before the implementation.
- **Confidence in Refactoring**: The comprehensive test suite allows for refactoring with confidence that existing functionality is not broken.
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as a form of documentation that describes what the code is supposed to do.

Example (Python):

```python
# Red: Write a failing test

# Red Test: Implement the function to make the test fail
def test_addition():
    assert addition(2, 3) == 5

# Green: Implement the function to make the test pass
def addition(a, b):
    return a + b

# Refactor: If necessary, refactor both the test and the implementation
# In this simple case, no refactoring needed.

# Run the test to confirm it passes
test_addition()
```
