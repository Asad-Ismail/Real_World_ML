    "simplified_problem": "Better activation functions for deep neural networks.",
    "problem_it_solved": "Traditional activation functions like sigmoid and tanh suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, where gradients become exponentially small as they propagate backward through many layers, making it difficult to train deep neural networks effectively. Additionally, these functions are computationally expensive due to their exponential operations.",
    "historical_context": "In 2009-2010, deep learning was gaining momentum with the success of deep belief networks and stacked autoencoders. However, training very deep networks remained challenging. The dominant activation functions were sigmoid (\u03c3(x) = 1/(1+e^(-x))) and tanh (tanh(x) = (e^x - e^(-x))/(e^x + e^(-x))). These functions saturate at both ends (approaching 0 or 1 for sigmoid, -1 or 1 for tanh), causing gradients to vanish when inputs fall into these saturated regions. This made it nearly impossible to train networks with more than a few layers effectively. Researchers were exploring various initialization schemes and pre-training techniques to mitigate these issues, but the fundamental problem with the activation functions themselves remained.",

        "concept": "Replace traditional sigmoid/tanh activation functions with the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), defined as f(x) = max(0, x). This simple piecewise linear function has several key properties: it does not saturate in the positive domain, it is computationally efficient (no exponentials), and it introduces sparsity by outputting exact zeros for negative inputs.",
        "math_foundation": "The ReLU function f(x) = max(0, x) has a derivative of 1 for x > 0 and 0 for x < 0. This means gradients can flow through active neurons without diminishing, while inactive neurons (x < 0) receive no gradient. The lack of saturation in the positive regime prevents the vanishing gradient problem that plagued sigmoid and tanh functions.",
        "implementation": "Replace all activation functions in neural networks with ReLU. For negative inputs, the output is zero; for positive inputs, the output is the input itself. This requires only a simple max operation, making it computationally efficient. In practice, ReLU is applied element-wise to the pre-activation values (z = Wx + b) to produce activations (a = ReLU(z)).",
        "verification": "The paper demonstrated that ReLU enabled training of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and deep networks more effectively than sigmoid units. Specifically, ReLU-RBMs achieved better generative performance on MNIST and NIST datasets, converged faster during training, and allowed for deeper architectures to be trained successfully without the need for pre-training.",
