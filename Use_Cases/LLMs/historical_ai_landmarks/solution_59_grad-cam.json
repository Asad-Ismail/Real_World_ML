    "simplified_problem": "Interpretable visual explanations for deep CNN decisions.",
    "problem_it_solved": "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks achieve remarkable performance on image classification tasks, but their decisions are opaque \"black boxes\" - we cannot understand which parts of an image the model uses to make its predictions. This lack of interpretability prevents trust in critical applications like medical diagnosis or autonomous driving, where understanding the model's reasoning is essential.",
    "historical_context": "Before 2016, researchers had developed some visualization techniques for CNNs, but they were limited. Deconvolution networks could visualize what patterns activate specific neurons, but required modifying the network architecture. Saliency maps based on gradients could highlight important pixels, but often produced noisy, low-resolution explanations that didn't clearly show which objects or regions the model focused on. There was no general method to produce high-quality, class-discriminative visual explanations for any CNN architecture without architectural changes.",

        "domain": "Computer Vision Interpretability",
        "title": "Grad-CAM: Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping",
        "concept": "Use the gradients of any target concept (like a predicted class) flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting important regions in the image for that concept. The gradients indicate the importance of each feature map for the target class, and these importance weights are used to compute a weighted combination of the feature maps.",
        "math_foundation": "Let y^c be the score for class c before softmax. Let A^k_ij be the activation of unit k in the last convolutional layer at spatial location (i,j). The gradient of y^c with respect to feature map A^k is computed: \u03b1_k^c = (1/Z) \u03a3_i \u03a3_j (\u2202y^c/\u2202A^k_ij). The Grad-CAM heatmap is then: L_Grad-CAM^c = ReLU(\u03a3_k \u03b1_k^c A^k). The ReLU ensures we only keep features with positive influence on the class.",
        "implementation": "1. Forward propagate the image through the CNN to get the class predictions. 2. Compute the gradient of the desired class score with respect to the feature maps of the last convolutional layer. 3. Global average pool these gradients to get the importance weights \u03b1_k^c for each feature map. 4. Compute the weighted combination of feature maps using these weights. 5. Apply ReLU to the linear combination and upsample to the input image size for visualization.",
        "verification": "Grad-CAM was evaluated on ImageNet classification, showing it could localize objects accurately without bounding box annotations. It was also tested on visual question answering, image captioning, and image classification tasks, demonstrating its general applicability. Human studies showed Grad-CAM explanations helped users establish trust in predictions and identify when models made mistakes.",
        "inspiration": "Class Activation Mapping (CAM) - Grad-CAM generalizes CAM to any CNN architecture without requiring global average pooling before the final layer."
