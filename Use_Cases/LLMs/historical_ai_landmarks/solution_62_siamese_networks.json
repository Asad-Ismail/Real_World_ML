    "problem_it_solved": "Traditional supervised learning approaches require large amounts of labeled data for each class and struggle with verification tasks where the goal is to determine whether two inputs belong to the same class. Face verification, in particular, presents a challenge where the system must verify identity given only one or a few examples per person, making traditional classification approaches impractical.",
    "historical_context": "Before 2005, face recognition systems primarily used hand-crafted features (like Eigenfaces or Fisherfaces) combined with simple distance metrics. Deep learning approaches were limited by the need for thousands of images per person for training. The prevailing paradigm was to train classifiers that required fixed, pre-defined classes with substantial training data per class. This made it impossible to verify identities of new people not seen during training, as the system couldn't generalize to novel classes with minimal examples.",

        "domain": "Metric Learning and Few-Shot Learning",
        "title": "Siamese Networks: Learning a Similarity Metric Discriminatively, with Application to Face Verification",
        "concept": "Instead of learning to classify inputs into fixed categories, learn a similarity function that maps pairs of inputs to a distance metric. Two identical neural networks (hence 'Siamese') process two inputs in parallel, producing embeddings. The distance between these embeddings indicates similarity - small distances for same-class pairs, large distances for different-class pairs. This enables verification of new classes with just one example.",
        "math_foundation": "The network learns a function G_W(X) that maps input X to a target space where the L1 distance between embeddings approximates the 'semantic' distance in input space. The loss function is: L(W) = \u03a3_i L_GW(X1_i, X2_i, Y_i), where Y_i = 0 if X1_i and X2_i are from the same class, 1 otherwise. The contrastive loss is: L_GW = (1-Y) * D_W^2 + Y * max(0, margin - D_W)^2, where D_W = ||G_W(X1) - G_W(X2)||.",
        "implementation": "Two identical CNNs share weights and process pairs of images. The final layer outputs a fixed-length embedding vector. During training, pairs are sampled from the dataset - positive pairs (same identity) and negative pairs (different identities). The contrastive loss is computed on the L1 distance between embeddings. At test time, given a new face image and a reference image, the system computes embeddings for both and compares their distance to a learned threshold.",
        "verification": "On the AT&T face database with 40 subjects, the Siamese network achieved 92.5% accuracy on one-shot verification tasks. More importantly, it demonstrated the ability to verify identities of people not seen during training, proving that the learned metric generalizes to novel classes with minimal examples.",
        "inspiration": "Signature verification systems and early work on metric learning, combined with the insight that learning a similarity function is more flexible than learning fixed class boundaries."
