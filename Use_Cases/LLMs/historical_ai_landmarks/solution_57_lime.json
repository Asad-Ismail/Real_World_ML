    "simplified_problem": "Model interpretability for black-box predictions",
    "problem_it_solved": "Complex machine learning models like deep neural networks and ensemble methods achieve high accuracy but operate as \"black boxes\" - their decision-making process is opaque and difficult to understand. This lack of interpretability prevents users from trusting model predictions, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and criminal justice where understanding why a model made a specific prediction is crucial for adoption and regulatory compliance.",
    "historical_context": "By 2016, deep learning had achieved remarkable success across various domains, with models like CNNs for image classification and RNNs for sequence tasks achieving superhuman performance on specific benchmarks. However, these models were increasingly complex, with millions of parameters and non-linear transformations that made it impossible to understand how inputs were mapped to outputs. Existing interpretability methods were either model-specific (like saliency maps for CNNs) or provided global explanations (like feature importance scores) that didn't explain individual predictions. There was a growing tension between model complexity/accuracy and interpretability, with practitioners forced to choose between powerful black-box models and simpler, interpretable ones like decision trees or linear models.",

        "domain": "Machine Learning Interpretability",
        "title": "LIME: Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations",
        "concept": "Explain any classifier's prediction by approximating the black-box model locally with an interpretable model. Instead of trying to understand the entire complex model globally, LIME focuses on explaining individual predictions by learning a simple, interpretable model (like linear regression or decision trees) that approximates the black-box model's behavior in the local neighborhood around the specific instance being explained.",
        "math_foundation": "Given a black-box model f and an instance x to explain, LIME samples points in the vicinity of x by perturbing it, obtains predictions f(z) for these perturbed samples z, and then learns an interpretable model g (e.g., linear model) that minimizes: $$\\xi(x) = \\arg\\min_{g \\in G} L(f, g, \\pi_x) + \\Omega(g)$$ where L measures how well g approximates f in the locality defined by proximity measure \u03c0_x, and \u03a9(g) penalizes complexity of g. The explanation is derived from the learned weights of g.",
        "implementation": "1. Given an instance x to explain, generate perturbed samples by randomly setting some features to zero (for text) or superpixel occlusion (for images). 2. Get predictions for these perturbed samples from the black-box model. 3. Weight these samples by their proximity to x using an exponential kernel. 4. Fit a sparse linear model (like Lasso) to these weighted samples. 5. The coefficients of this linear model indicate which features most contributed to the prediction, providing human-interpretable explanations.",
        "verification": "LIME was evaluated on various tasks including text classification (sentiment analysis), image classification, and healthcare predictions. Human subjects were able to identify which classifiers to trust based on LIME explanations, and the explanations helped practitioners identify problematic models. For instance, LIME revealed that a 'husky vs wolf' classifier was actually using snow in the background as a discriminative feature rather than the animals themselves.",
        "inspiration": "Philosophy of science (understanding through local approximation), perturbation analysis techniques, and the principle that complex global behavior can be understood through simpler local explanations."
