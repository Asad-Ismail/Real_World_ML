    "problem_it_solved": "How can we perform efficient inference and learning in directed probabilistic models with continuous latent variables, where the posterior distribution over latent variables is intractable and the dataset is large? Traditional approaches like MCMC or variational mean-field methods either scale poorly to large datasets or make overly restrictive independence assumptions.",
    "historical_context": "Before 2013, training deep generative models with latent variables faced significant challenges. Methods like Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) required layer-wise pretraining and complex sampling procedures. Variational inference methods existed but typically required model-specific derivations and often used mean-field approximations that ignored dependencies between latent variables. The reparameterization trick for backpropagating through stochastic nodes was not widely used, making it difficult to integrate probabilistic models with deep learning frameworks. The field needed a general framework that could combine the representational power of neural networks with principled probabilistic inference.",

        "domain": "Probabilistic Deep Learning",
        "title": "Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes",
        "concept": "Introduce a recognition model (encoder) to approximate the intractable posterior p(z|x) with a simpler distribution q(z|x), typically a Gaussian. Simultaneously train a generative model (decoder) p(x|z) to reconstruct the data. The training objective is the Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO), which balances reconstruction quality with how close q(z|x) is to the prior p(z). The key insight is the reparameterization trick that enables backpropagation through stochastic nodes by expressing random variables as deterministic transformations of noise.",
        "math_foundation": "The ELBO is derived from log p(x) = KL(q(z|x)||p(z|x)) + ELBO, where ELBO = E_q(z|x)[log p(x|z)] - KL(q(z|x)||p(z)). The reparameterization trick rewrites z ~ q(z|x) as z = \u03bc(x) + \u03c3(x) \u2299 \u03b5, where \u03b5 ~ N(0,I), making the sampling operation differentiable. This allows gradient-based optimization of both encoder and decoder parameters jointly.",
        "implementation": "The encoder is a neural network that outputs parameters (\u03bc, log \u03c3\u00b2) of the approximate posterior q(z|x). The decoder is another neural network that maps latent variables z to the data space. During training: (1) encode x to get q(z|x), (2) sample z using reparameterization, (3) decode z to reconstruct x, (4) compute ELBO loss = reconstruction_loss + KL_divergence, (5) backpropagate through both networks.",
        "verification": "Demonstrated on MNIST, the VAE achieved competitive log-likelihood scores while being able to generate novel samples from the prior. Showed smooth interpolation in latent space and the ability to learn disentangled representations. The framework was general enough to be applied to various data types including images, text, and speech.",
        "inspiration": "Variational inference methods in Bayesian statistics, autoencoders in neural networks, and the wake-sleep algorithm for Helmholtz machines."
