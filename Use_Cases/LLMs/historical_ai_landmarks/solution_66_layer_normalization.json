    "simplified_problem": "Stable training of deep neural networks with improved optimization dynamics.",
    "problem_it_solved": "Deep neural networks suffer from internal covariate shift, where the distribution of layer inputs changes during training, causing training instability and requiring careful initialization and small learning rates. Batch Normalization addressed this but has limitations: it depends on batch size, performs poorly with small batches or recurrent networks, and cannot be applied to online learning or sequence models with varying lengths.",
    "historical_context": "In 2015, Batch Normalization (BN) emerged as a breakthrough technique to stabilize training by normalizing inputs to each layer across the batch dimension. While BN significantly improved training speed and enabled deeper networks, it had clear drawbacks: it required sufficiently large batch sizes (typically 32+), couldn't handle variable-length sequences well, and introduced dependencies between samples in the same batch. These limitations were particularly problematic for recurrent neural networks, online learning scenarios, and tasks where batching was impractical. Researchers needed an alternative normalization technique that could work effectively across all these scenarios.",

        "domain": "Deep Learning Optimization",
        "title": "Layer Normalization",
        "concept": "Instead of normalizing across the batch dimension like Batch Normalization, Layer Normalization normalizes across the feature dimension for each individual training example. This makes it independent of batch size and applicable to recurrent networks and online learning scenarios.",
        "math_foundation": "For a layer with d-dimensional input x = (x\u2081, x\u2082, ..., x_d), Layer Normalization computes: \u03bc = (1/d)\u2211\u1d62x\u1d62, \u03c3\u00b2 = (1/d)\u2211\u1d62(x\u1d62 - \u03bc)\u00b2, then outputs y\u1d62 = \u03b3\u1d62 * (x\u1d62 - \u03bc)/\u221a(\u03c3\u00b2 + \u03b5) + \u03b2\u1d62, where \u03b3 and \u03b2 are learned parameters. This ensures the output has zero mean and unit variance across features for each sample.",
        "implementation": "Apply normalization to the summed inputs to neurons within a layer. For RNNs, apply it to the linearly transformed inputs before the activation function in each time step. The same normalization parameters (\u03b3, \u03b2) are shared across all time steps, making it particularly effective for sequence modeling.",
        "verification": "Layer Normalization achieved comparable or better performance than Batch Normalization on image classification tasks while significantly outperforming it on RNN-based tasks. On the Penn Treebank language modeling task, Layer Normalized LSTMs achieved 78.4 perplexity compared to 90.3 for standard LSTMs, demonstrating its effectiveness for sequence modeling.",
        "inspiration": "Statistical normalization techniques and the observation that neural network training could benefit from maintaining stable input distributions without batch dependencies."
