    "simplified_problem": "Maximum-margin classification for high-dimensional data",
    "problem_it_solved": "Traditional learning algorithms like neural networks and decision trees struggled with generalization in high-dimensional spaces, often overfitting to training data. There was a need for a principled approach that could guarantee good generalization performance by maximizing the margin between different classes, especially when dealing with non-linearly separable data.",
    "historical_context": "In the mid-1990s, neural networks dominated machine learning but suffered from issues like local minima, overfitting, and lack of theoretical guarantees. The VC theory had established that generalization depends on the margin between classes, but practical algorithms to maximize this margin were lacking. Kernel methods were emerging as powerful tools for handling non-linear relationships, but existing approaches like radial basis function networks lacked the theoretical foundation to ensure optimal generalization. The field needed a classifier that could work in very high (even infinite) dimensional spaces while maintaining computational tractability and providing theoretical guarantees on generalization performance.",

        "title": "Support Vector Machines (Support-Vector Networks)",
        "concept": "Find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes by solving a convex quadratic optimization problem. The decision boundary depends only on the 'support vectors' - the training points closest to the hyperplane. For non-linearly separable data, map inputs to a higher-dimensional feature space using kernel functions, where linear separation becomes possible.",
        "math_foundation": "The optimization problem is: minimize 1/2||w||\u00b2 subject to y_i(w\u00b7x_i + b) \u2265 1 for all i. This is a convex quadratic programming problem with a unique global minimum. The dual formulation uses Lagrange multipliers: maximize \u03a3\u03b1_i - 1/2 \u03a3\u03a3\u03b1_i\u03b1_j y_i y_j (x_i\u00b7x_j) subject to \u03a3\u03b1_i y_i = 0 and \u03b1_i \u2265 0. The kernel trick replaces x_i\u00b7x_j with K(x_i, x_j), allowing computation in infinite-dimensional spaces.",
        "implementation": "Transform the classification problem into a convex optimization problem that can be solved efficiently. Use kernel functions (polynomial, RBF, sigmoid) to implicitly map data to high-dimensional spaces without explicit computation. The resulting classifier has the form f(x) = sign(\u03a3\u03b1_i y_i K(x_i, x) + b), where only support vectors (\u03b1_i > 0) contribute to the decision.",
        "verification": "SVMs achieved state-of-the-art results on handwritten digit recognition (MNIST), achieving 1.1% error rate compared to 2.7% for neural networks. They also demonstrated excellent performance on text categorization, outperforming k-NN and neural networks while requiring fewer training examples.",
