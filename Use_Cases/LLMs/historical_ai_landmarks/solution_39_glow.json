    "simplified_problem": "Exact likelihood estimation for high-resolution images",
    "problem_it_solved": "Training generative models that can compute the exact likelihood of data (not just a lower bound) while maintaining the ability to generate high-quality samples was computationally intractable for high-dimensional data like images. Existing flow-based models were either too shallow to model complex distributions or too computationally expensive to scale to high resolutions.",
    "historical_context": "Before Glow, generative modeling was dominated by three approaches: GANs (which produced sharp samples but couldn't compute likelihood), VAEs (which could compute a lower bound on likelihood but produced blurry samples), and early flow-based models like RealNVP. While RealNVP introduced the concept of invertible transformations for exact likelihood computation, it used simple coupling layers that required channel partitioning, limiting the expressiveness of the transformations. This made it difficult to scale to high-resolution images (256x256 and above) while maintaining both computational efficiency and model expressiveness.",

        "domain": "Generative Modeling",
        "title": "Glow: Generative Flow with Invertible 1x1 Convolutions",
        "concept": "A flow-based generative model that uses invertible 1x1 convolutions as a more flexible and expressive alternative to the channel partitioning used in RealNVP. The model stacks multiple layers of actnorm (activation normalization), invertible 1x1 convolutions, and affine coupling layers to create highly expressive transformations while maintaining exact invertibility and tractable likelihood computation.",
        "math_foundation": "The model learns an invertible mapping f: X \u2192 Z where X is the data space and Z is a latent space with a simple prior (typically standard Gaussian). The exact log-likelihood is computed using the change of variables formula: log p_X(x) = log p_Z(f(x)) + log|det(df/dx)|. The invertible 1x1 convolution uses a weight matrix W \u2208 \u211d^{c\u00d7c} where c is the number of channels, with log-determinant log|det(W)| efficiently computed during training.",
        "implementation": "The architecture consists of multiple 'steps' where each step contains: (1) Actnorm: per-channel normalization with learned scale and bias parameters, (2) Invertible 1x1 convolution: a learned linear transformation across channels implemented as a 1x1 convolution with weight matrix W, (3) Affine coupling layer: splits channels into two halves and applies an affine transformation conditioned on one half. These steps are organized into 'levels' that progressively reduce spatial dimensions while increasing channels.",
        "verification": "Glow achieved state-of-the-art log-likelihood on standard benchmarks (CIFAR-10: 3.35 bits/dim, ImageNet 32x32: 4.09 bits/dim, ImageNet 64x64: 3.81 bits/dim) while being able to generate high-quality 256x256 images. The model demonstrated that exact likelihood computation could scale to high-resolution images without sacrificing sample quality.",
        "inspiration": "RealNVP (flow-based generative models), WaveGlow (1x1 convolutions in audio generation), and the general framework of normalizing flows."
