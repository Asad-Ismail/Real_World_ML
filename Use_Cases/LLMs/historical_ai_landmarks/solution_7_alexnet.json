    "problem_it_solved": "How can we achieve breakthrough performance on large-scale image classification tasks like ImageNet, which contains over 1 million high-resolution images across 1000 categories, when traditional computer vision approaches are hitting performance plateaus and cannot effectively leverage massive datasets?",
    "historical_context": "Before 2012, the dominant approaches for image classification relied on hand-crafted features like SIFT, HOG, and SURF combined with shallow classifiers like SVMs or random forests. While these methods had achieved some success on smaller datasets like Caltech-101 or PASCAL VOC, they struggled with ImageNet's scale and complexity. The best performance on ImageNet 2011 was around 25.8% top-5 error rate using traditional methods. Deep learning had shown promise with smaller datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10, but attempts to scale neural networks to ImageNet had failed due to computational constraints and overfitting. GPUs were primarily used for graphics, not deep learning, and the largest published convolutional networks at the time had only 8 layers and were trained on datasets orders of magnitude smaller than ImageNet.",

        "domain": "Computer Vision",
        "title": "ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks",
        "concept": "A large, deep convolutional neural network with 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consisting of 5 convolutional layers (some followed by max-pooling) and 3 fully-connected layers. The network uses ReLU activations instead of tanh/sigmoid, employs dropout for regularization, and leverages data augmentation to prevent overfitting on the massive ImageNet dataset.",
        "math_foundation": "The network is trained using stochastic gradient descent with momentum to minimize the multinomial logistic regression objective. The key innovation was the use of ReLU activation function f(x) = max(0,x) which accelerates convergence by avoiding the vanishing gradient problem present in sigmoid/tanh activations. The final layer uses softmax: p_i = exp(x_i)/sum(exp(x_j)) for class probabilities.",
        "implementation": "The architecture processes 224\u00d7224\u00d73 input images through: (1) Conv-96-ReLU-MaxPool, (2) Conv-256-ReLU-MaxPool, (3) Conv-384-ReLU, (4) Conv-384-ReLU, (5) Conv-256-ReLU-MaxPool, (6) FC-4096-ReLU-Dropout, (7) FC-4096-ReLU-Dropout, (8) FC-1000-Softmax. Training was parallelized across two GTX 580 GPUs using a novel scheme where kernels are split across GPUs. Data augmentation included horizontal flips, random crops, and PCA-based color augmentation.",
        "verification": "Achieved 37.5% top-1 and 17.0% top-5 error rates on ILSVRC-2012, significantly outperforming the second-best entry (26.2% top-5). This 10.8 percentage point improvement demonstrated that deep CNNs could effectively learn hierarchical features directly from pixels, sparking the deep learning revolution in computer vision.",
        "inspiration": "Neuroscience (hierarchical processing in visual cortex) and earlier work on small-scale CNNs (LeNet-5)"
