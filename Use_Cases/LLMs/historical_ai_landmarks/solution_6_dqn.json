    "problem_it_solved": "How can an agent learn to play Atari 2600 games directly from raw pixel inputs, without any game-specific knowledge or hand-crafted features, achieving human-level performance across a diverse set of games?",
    "historical_context": "Before 2013, reinforcement learning approaches for game playing relied heavily on hand-engineered features and domain knowledge. Methods like TD-Gammon for backgammon or earlier Atari-playing systems required careful feature design specific to each game. The state-of-the-art for Atari games used linear function approximation with hand-crafted features like RAM values or object locations. These approaches struggled with high-dimensional visual inputs and couldn't generalize across different games. The challenge was particularly acute for Atari 2600 games, which have 128x128 pixel displays with 128 colors, creating a state space of 128^(128\u00d7128) possible configurations - far too large for traditional tabular methods or simple function approximation.",

        "domain": "Deep Reinforcement Learning",
        "title": "Deep Q-Network (DQN)",
        "concept": "Combine deep neural networks with Q-learning to approximate the optimal action-value function Q*(s,a) directly from raw pixels. Use a convolutional neural network to process high-dimensional visual inputs and output Q-values for each possible action, enabling the agent to learn effective policies without any game-specific features.",
        "math_foundation": "The Q-learning update: Q(s,a) \u2190 Q(s,a) + \u03b1[r + \u03b3 max_a' Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]. The neural network is trained to minimize the loss: L(\u03b8) = E[(r + \u03b3 max_a' Q(s',a'; \u03b8\u207b) - Q(s,a; \u03b8))\u00b2], where \u03b8\u207b are the parameters of a separate 'target network' that is updated less frequently to stabilize training.",
        "implementation": "Architecture: A deep convolutional neural network with 3 convolutional layers followed by 2 fully-connected layers. Input: 84\u00d784\u00d74 stack of the last 4 frames (to capture motion). Output: Q-values for each of the 18 possible joystick actions. Key innovations: (1) Experience replay buffer to store and sample random mini-batches of past experiences, breaking correlations in the data stream. (2) Separate target network updated every 10,000 steps to provide stable targets. (3) \u03b5-greedy exploration with \u03b5 annealed from 1.0 to 0.1 over 1 million frames.",
        "verification": "Tested on 49 Atari 2600 games. Achieved human-level performance on 29 games and outperformed previous RL methods on 43 games. Notable results: 100% human performance on Breakout, 83% on Video Pinball, 54% on Boxing. The same architecture and hyperparameters were used across all games without any game-specific tuning.",
        "inspiration": "Neuroscience (biological reinforcement learning and visual processing), TD-Gammon (temporal difference learning), and the success of CNNs in computer vision."
