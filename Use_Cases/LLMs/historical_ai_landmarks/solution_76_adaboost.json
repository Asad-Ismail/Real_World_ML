    "historical_context": "In the mid-1990s, the dominant paradigm in machine learning was to design ever more sophisticated single models. Ensemble methods existed (like bagging), but they typically required the base learners to already be reasonably strong. The theoretical question of whether weak learners could be boosted to become strong learners had been posed by Kearns and Valiant in 1988, but no practical algorithm existed. Most approaches either required prior knowledge about the weak learner's performance or were computationally infeasible. The challenge was to create an adaptive algorithm that could automatically focus on the \"hard\" examples that the current ensemble was getting wrong.",

        "title": "AdaBoost: A Decision-Theoretic Generalization of On-Line Learning and an Application to Boosting",
        "concept": "An iterative algorithm that adaptively reweights training examples, giving more importance to those that previous classifiers misclassified. Each round, it trains a new weak learner on this reweighted distribution, then adds it to the ensemble with a weight based on its accuracy. The final classifier is a weighted majority vote of all weak learners.",
        "math_foundation": "The algorithm minimizes an exponential loss function: L = \u03a3 exp(-y_i f(x_i)), where f(x) = \u03a3 \u03b1_t h_t(x) is the final strong classifier. At each iteration t, the weight update is w_i^(t+1) = w_i^(t) * exp(\u03b1_t * I[y_i \u2260 h_t(x_i)]), where \u03b1_t = \u00bd ln((1-\u03b5_t)/\u03b5_t) and \u03b5_t is the weighted error of the weak learner h_t.",
        "implementation": "Start with equal weights on all training examples. For T iterations: (1) Train weak learner on weighted data, (2) Compute weighted error \u03b5_t, (3) Set learner weight \u03b1_t = \u00bd ln((1-\u03b5_t)/\u03b5_t), (4) Update example weights: increase weights of misclassified examples, decrease weights of correctly classified ones, (5) Normalize weights. Final classifier: sign(\u03a3 \u03b1_t h_t(x)).",
        "verification": "AdaBoost achieved state-of-the-art results on the UCI repository benchmarks, reducing error rates from 13.4% to 3.1% on the letter recognition task and from 5.7% to 0.7% on the sonar task. Theoretically, it was proven that if each weak learner has error \u03b5_t < \u00bd, the training error drops exponentially fast.",
        "inspiration": "Computational learning theory (specifically the PAC learning framework and the boosting question), online learning algorithms, and the concept of focusing on 'hard' examples."
