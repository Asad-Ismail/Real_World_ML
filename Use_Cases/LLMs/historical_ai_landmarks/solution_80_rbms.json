    "problem_it_solved": "How can we learn meaningful, hierarchical representations from unlabeled data without requiring labeled examples, while also being able to model complex probability distributions over high-dimensional inputs like images?",
    "historical_context": "In the mid-2000s, deep learning was struggling with training multi-layer neural networks. While backpropagation worked for supervised learning, it was difficult to apply to unsupervised pre-training. Traditional approaches like autoencoders could learn representations but often produced poor generative models. The field needed a way to learn features layer-by-layer in an unsupervised manner that could serve as good initialization for deeper networks, while also providing a proper probabilistic model of the data. Previous work on Boltzmann Machines was theoretically appealing but computationally intractable for practical applications.",

        "domain": "Unsupervised Learning and Deep Learning",
        "title": "Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)",
        "concept": "A bipartite graphical model consisting of visible units (representing observed data) and hidden units (representing latent features) with connections only between layers, not within them. This restriction makes inference tractable while still capturing complex dependencies in the data. RBMs learn to model the data distribution by maximizing the likelihood of observed data through contrastive divergence.",
        "math_foundation": "The joint probability distribution is defined by an energy function: P(v,h) = (1/Z) * exp(-E(v,h)) where E(v,h) = -a^T v - b^T h - v^T W h. The partition function Z ensures normalization. Learning involves maximizing the log-likelihood using contrastive divergence: \u0394W = \u03b5(<vh^T>_data - <vh^T>_recon) where the angle brackets denote expectations under the data and reconstruction distributions.",
        "implementation": "Training involves: (1) Initialize weights randomly, (2) Positive phase: sample hidden states given visible data, (3) Negative phase: reconstruct visible states from hidden samples, then sample hidden again, (4) Update weights using contrastive divergence with a small learning rate, (5) Use persistent chains (persistent CD) or multiple steps of Gibbs sampling for better approximations. Practical tricks include using momentum, weight decay, and sparsity regularization.",
        "verification": "RBMs demonstrated success on MNIST digit generation and classification tasks, achieving competitive results when used for pre-training deep belief networks. They could generate realistic samples from learned distributions and the learned features served as effective initializations for supervised neural networks, improving classification accuracy compared to random initialization.",
        "inspiration": "Statistical Physics (Boltzmann distribution from thermodynamics) and earlier work on Hopfield networks and general Boltzmann Machines."
