    "problem_it_solved": "How can we leverage the powerful feature representations learned by deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to perform accurate object detection, which requires both localizing objects with bounding boxes and classifying them, when existing approaches relied on hand-engineered features and sliding window classifiers that were computationally expensive and had limited accuracy?",
    "historical_context": "Before R-CNN, the dominant approaches for object detection were based on combinations of hand-engineered features (like HOG, SIFT) and shallow classifiers (like SVMs or boosted decision trees). These systems typically used sliding window approaches or region proposal methods like Selective Search, but were limited by the expressiveness of hand-crafted features. While CNNs had shown great success in image classification (AlexNet won ImageNet 2012), they hadn't been successfully applied to the more complex task of object detection, which requires precise localization in addition to classification. The challenge was bridging the gap between CNNs trained for whole-image classification and the need to detect multiple objects of varying sizes and positions within an image.",

        "domain": "Computer Vision",
        "title": "R-CNN: Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation",
        "concept": "A three-stage pipeline that combines region proposals with CNN features: (1) Use Selective Search to generate ~2000 category-independent region proposals from the input image, (2) Extract fixed-length feature vectors from each proposal by warping it to a fixed size and passing it through a CNN pre-trained on ImageNet classification, (3) Classify each region using class-specific linear SVMs and refine the bounding box locations using regression.",
        "math_foundation": "The CNN learns a function f: R^H\u00d7W\u00d73 \u2192 R^4096 that maps a warped region proposal to a 4096-dimensional feature vector. For classification, a one-vs-rest linear SVM is trained for each class c with weight vector w_c, computing scores w_c^T f(x_i) for each region x_i. For bounding box regression, a class-specific regressor learns to predict the transformation from the proposed box to the ground-truth box using least squares regression.",
        "implementation": "Use Selective Search to extract ~2000 region proposals per image. Warp each proposal to 227\u00d7227 pixels (regardless of original aspect ratio). Pass through a CNN (AlexNet) pre-trained on ImageNet, using the 4096-dimensional output from the fc7 layer as features. Train linear SVMs for each object class using these features. Apply non-maximum suppression to remove duplicate detections. Train bounding box regressors to refine the localization.",
        "verification": "R-CNN achieved a mAP of 53.3% on PASCAL VOC 2010 (compared to 35.1% for the previous best method), and 31.4% mAP on ILSVRC2013 detection (compared to 22.8% for OverFeat). The paper demonstrated that CNN features were far more effective than hand-engineered features for object detection, establishing a new paradigm for the field.",
        "inspiration": "The success of CNNs in image classification (AlexNet) and the use of region proposals in earlier detection systems (like Selective Search)."
