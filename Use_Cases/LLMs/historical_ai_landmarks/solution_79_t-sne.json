    "problem_it_solved": "How can we effectively visualize high-dimensional data (hundreds or thousands of dimensions) in a 2D or 3D space while preserving the local neighborhood structure and revealing meaningful clusters or patterns that exist in the original high-dimensional space?",
    "historical_context": "Before t-SNE, common dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and classical multidimensional scaling (MDS) focused on preserving global structure and linear relationships, often failing to capture the complex, non-linear manifold structure of real-world data. These methods would typically place dissimilar points far apart but couldn't reliably keep similar points close together, leading to visualizations where meaningful clusters in high dimensions appeared scattered or overlapped in 2D/3D space. There was a need for a technique that specifically preserved local neighborhoods to reveal the intrinsic geometry of complex datasets.",

        "domain": "Dimensionality Reduction and Data Visualization",
        "title": "Visualizing Data using t-SNE",
        "concept": "t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) converts the high-dimensional Euclidean distances between data points into conditional probabilities that represent similarities. It then finds a low-dimensional embedding where similar points have similar conditional probabilities. The key innovation is using a Student t-distribution (with one degree of freedom) in the low-dimensional space, which has heavier tails than a Gaussian, allowing dissimilar points to be modeled far apart without incurring infinite cost.",
        "math_foundation": "In high-dimensional space: p_{j|i} = exp(-||x_i - x_j||^2 / 2\u03c3_i^2) / \u03a3_{k\u2260i} exp(-||x_i - x_k||^2 / 2\u03c3_i^2), where \u03c3_i is set such that the perplexity (effective number of neighbors) matches a user-specified value. In low-dimensional space: q_{ij} = (1 + ||y_i - y_j||^2)^{-1} / \u03a3_{k\u2260l} (1 + ||y_k - y_l||^2)^{-1}. The cost function is the KL divergence: C = \u03a3_i \u03a3_j p_{ij} log(p_{ij}/q_{ij}).",
        "implementation": "1. Compute pairwise similarities p_{ij} in high-dimensional space using a Gaussian kernel with adaptive bandwidths. 2. Initialize low-dimensional points randomly. 3. Minimize the KL divergence between high and low-dimensional similarities using gradient descent with momentum. 4. The gradient has an attractive force for nearby points and a repulsive force for distant points, with the t-distribution preventing the crowding problem.",
        "verification": "Demonstrated on multiple datasets including MNIST handwritten digits, COIL-20 object images, and word embeddings, where t-SNE successfully revealed meaningful clusters and manifold structure that were not visible with PCA or other linear methods. For MNIST, it clearly separated digit classes and revealed continuous manifolds within each digit class.",
        "inspiration": "Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE) - t-SNE improved upon SNE by using the t-distribution instead of Gaussian in low-dimensional space to address the crowding problem, and by simplifying the symmetric version of the cost function."
